# 🏦 Loan Approval Prediction - Supervised ML Pipeline

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements an **End-to-End Supervised Machine Learning Pipeline** to predict loan approval status.  
It applies multiple classification algorithms and compares their performance to determine the best-performing model.

The pipeline includes:
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Model Building
- Model Evaluation
- Model Saving for Deployment
